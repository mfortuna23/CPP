# CPP Modules

## 📖 Overview

CPP Modules is a collection of progressive C++ projects developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. The goal of this project is to introduce and deepen understanding of modern C++ (C++98) concepts through hands-on exercises, moving from basic syntax to advanced object-oriented and generic programming principles.

Each module focuses on a specific set of C++ features and best practices, reinforcing strong design, memory safety, and code readability.

| Module    | Topics Covered                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CPP00** | Namespaces, classes, member functions, std::string, I/O streams    |
| **CPP01** | Memory allocation, references, pointers, switch statements         |
| **CPP02** | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical Form |
| **CPP03** | Inheritance, access specifiers, virtual functions                  |
| **CPP04** | Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces                 |
| **CPP05** | Exceptions, error handling, nested classes                         |
| **CPP06** | Type casting (`static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, etc.)                 |
| **CPP07** | Templates, generic programming                                     |
| **CPP08** | STL containers, iterators                                          |
| **CPP09** | Advanced STL usage, parsing, algorithms, performance optimization  |

## 🚀 Key Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming

Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

Memory Management

Stack vs heap allocation

Constructors, destructors, copy semantics

C++ Canonical Form

Rule of Three

Templates & STL

Generic programming

Containers, iterators, algorithms

Error Handling

Exceptions and safe code practices

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
Prerequisites

C++ compiler compatible with C++98

Make

Linux or macOS


### Build & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mfortuna23/cpp
cd cpp
cd cppXX/exXX
make
./program_name
```
Each exercise directory contains its own Makefile and executable.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

Understand and apply C++ OOP principles

Write clean, maintainable, and idiomatic C++

Manage resources safely and correctly

Gain confidence using STL and templates

Transition smoothly from C to C++
